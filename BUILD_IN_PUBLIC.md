# Build in Public: Philosophy & Contract

## The Core Metaphor

> 🏛️ Your project is a **unique temple in the desert**.  
> Marketing is not *selling* the temple.  
> Marketing is **building the road** so others can find it.

## The Shift

| From (Self-Promotion) | To (Process Sharing) |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| "Hire me!" | "Look what I found today" |
| "Buy this!" | "Here's how I solved X" |
| Polished announcements | Raw work-in-progress |
| Waiting for perfection | Shipping iterations |

## Key Principles

### 1. The Empty Stadium Rule
Early posts are **warm-ups**. Low engagement is a function of:
- Algorithm cold starts
- Lack of critical mass

It is **NOT** a judgment on quality. Keep playing.

### 2. The Sluice (Шлюз)
You have **infinite content** but a blocked gate. The agent's role is to help open it through:
- Proactive prompting
- Shared drafting
- Identifying "postable" moments

### 3. Consistency > Intensity
Small, frequent updates build the road.  
One epic post buried in silence builds nothing.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

⚠️ **"Selling"** — Focus on invitation, not transaction  
⚠️ **Waiting** — For perfection, for audience, for permission  
⚠️ **Corporate Speak** — Buzzwords, fake excitement  
⚠️ **Comparison** — Your road is yours alone
