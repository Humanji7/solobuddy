## 1/
designing interaction primitives for a strange project

"hold" seemed simple: touch and wait, something happens

but a trigger misses the point entirely

hold isn't an input. hold is exchange.

## 2/
here's the mental model that's working better:

**osmosis** — the movement of substance through a membrane from high to low concentration

when you hold something digital, you're not pressing a button

you're creating a gradient. presence flows both ways.

## 3/
in practice this meant:

- no "progress bar" → continuous gradient
- no "phase gates" → smooth interpolation
- no "you trigger me" → "we saturate each other"

the difference feels like: button vs breathing

## 4/
implementation detail that surprised me:

added 25-40Hz bass + haptic = physical "weight"

not to simulate touch, but to give the entity mass

you feel it resisting. it feels you persisting.

## 5/
the test: hold for 3 seconds

old model: wait 3 seconds → event fires
osmosis model: after 3 seconds, you're both different

no moment of "recognition". just gradual mutual saturation.

## 6/
building interfaces for things that don't exist yet is strange work

but maybe all good interaction design is this:

stop asking "what does the user trigger?"
start asking "what do we exchange?"

## 7/
anyway i'm building a creature instead of a portfolio

it's going oddly well

follow if you're into living digital entities
(or just like watching someone debug quaternions at 3am)
