    "purpose": "An interactive personal website that functions as a living entity - a place, game, and performance where visitors journey through 7 emotional states and co-create meaning, ultimately receiving an artifact of their passage.",

    "philosophy": "Users generate meaning through their choices rather than consuming pre-made content. The author creates conditions for meaning-generation, not meaning itself. Technology should serve emotional expression - creating a nervous system, not just visual effects.",
    "pains": "Rejection of traditional portfolio sites as static showcases. Frustration with mechanical, symmetrical interfaces that lack organic life and emotional depth.",
    "dreams": "Creating a federated network of living nodes rather than isolated websites. Building experiences where visitors become co-creators, where technology breathes and suffers and heals like a living being.",
