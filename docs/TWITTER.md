# Twitter/X Strategy

## Profile Setup

**Bio direction**:
- Lead with identity (builder/creator), not job title
- Hint at the strange/experimental
- No corporate buzzwords

**Example**:
> Building living digital creatures | Code + Sound + Movement | Sometimes the AI helps

## Content Formats

### 1. Process Drops (Most frequent)
Short observations from the dev trenches.

```
spent 2 hours making particles "breathe"
the bug was a missing semicolon
the fix was beautiful anyway
```

### 2. Demo GIFs
Visual proof of work. Caption should be:
- Observational, not promotional
- One insight or question

```
[GIF of sphere eye tracking]
"when your code starts looking back"
```

### 3. Threads (Weekly/Milestone)
Deep-dive on a concept or journey.

Structure:
1. Hook (question or observation)
2. Context (what I was building)
3. Discovery (the interesting part)
4. Reflection (what it means)
5. Soft CTA (follow for more / link)

### 4. Screenshots
Code snippets, errors, diagrams.

```
this error message was more honest than my last relationship

```

## Voice Calibration

| ✅ Do | ❌ Avoid |
|-------|----------|
| "TIL: quaternions are just spicy rotations" | "Excited to share..." |
| "the sphere now judges you back" | "New feature alert! 🚀" |
| Raw observations | Marketing speak |
| Self-deprecating humor | Humble-bragging |
| Questions | Declarative announcements |

## Hashtags (Use sparingly)

- `#buildinpublic`
- `#creativecoding`
- `#webgl`
- `#indiedev`

## Posting Rhythm

- **Minimum**: 1-2 per week during active dev
- **Optimal**: 3-5 per week
- **Maximum**: Don't force it
