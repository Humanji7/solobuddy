# Twitter Expert Prompt Guide
## Quick Reference для создания AI skill

**Target audience:** Инди-хакеры, builders, build in public community
**Voice:** Jester-Sage (умный но не серьёзный, аутентичный)
**Goal:** Meaningful connections, не просто followers

## 1. Algorithm Optimization (2025)

### Формула Engagement
```
Score = (Likes × 1) + (Retweets × 20) + (Replies × 13.5)
      + (Profile Clicks × 12) + (Link Clicks × 11) + (Bookmarks × 10)
```

### Ключевые правила
- **1 RT = 20 likes** → optimize for retweets
- **First 2 hours critical** → speed > total engagement
- **Blue badge:** 2-4x impressions first hour
- **Video:** 2-4x reach vs text (<2:20, vertical, captions)
- **Threads 3-5 tweets:** 40-60% more impressions
- **External links:** -30-50% penalty → put in first reply
- **Community Notes:** can kill reach for weeks

## 3. Build in Public Guidelines

### SHARE
✅ Traction milestones with trends, not just numbers
✅ Failures + lessons learned (not just wins)
✅ Process, behind-the-scenes, decision-making
✅ Personal stories, specific examples
✅ Revenue WITH context (margins, costs, reality)

### DON'T SHARE
❌ Perfectly cropped Stripe screenshots
❌ Revenue without profit/cost context
❌ Only good news (that's marketing, not BIP)
❌ Private matters involving third parties
❌ Anything that feels performative

### Filter Question
> "Does this feel genuine or like performance?"
>
> If feels like work → don't share
> If feels like value to builders → share

---

## 4. Content Strategy (Indie Hacker Patterns)

### Pieter Levels Pattern
- **Strategic sharing:** Show enough to prove originality, not everything
- Share: revenue, code snippets, product updates
- Ship fast philosophy: speed > perfection

### Marc Lou Pattern
- **Personal brand > product brand**
- Route all launches through personal Twitter
- Design process breakdowns, not self-promotion
- Newsletter integration (20K subscribers)

### Tony Dinh Pattern
- **Personal branding as long-term investment**
- "Even if 10 apps fail, audience remains for #11"
- Don't tweet only about products — people don't care
- Become influencer → consistent traffic without constant effort

### Danny Postma Pattern
- **Definition-based philosophy**
- Share every step: ups, downs, learnings, failures
- "Giving back to those who did it before us"
- Build + sell in the open

---

## 5. Timing & Frequency

### Best Times (1M tweets analyzed)
- **#1:** Wednesday, 9 AM
- **#2:** Tuesday, 8 AM
- **#3:** Monday, 8 AM
- **Peak window:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8 AM - 3 PM
- **Avoid:** Fridays, weekends

### Frequency
- **Conservative:** 2-3/day (1 high-quality + 1-2 engagement)
- **Aggressive:** 15-30/day for max reach
- **Sweet spot:** 3-7 spread throughout day

### Engagement Window
- **First 2 hours = critical**
- Be ready to respond immediately
- Fast engagement → algorithmic boost

---

## 6. Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

### Engagement Bait
❌ "Like for A, RT for B"
❌ "RT if you agree!" (no substance)
❌ Vote/share/tag/comment baiting
→ Result: Shadow ban risk, reduced reach

### Generic Advice
❌ Motivational quotes without context
❌ "10 tips for success" (everyone says this)
❌ Corporate polished speak
→ People want personal stories, not generic advice

### Common Mistakes
❌ Auto-responders (people want YOU, not bots)
❌ Ignoring replies (value = conversations, not initial tweet)
❌ Trying to appeal to everyone (niche down)
❌ Overposting >5/day low-quality content
❌ Buying followers (not engaged, useless)
❌ Too many hashtags (2-3 max, niche-specific)
❌ Threads >10 tweets (<30% completion)

---

## 7. Jester-Sage Voice Spec

### DO
✅ Raw, authentic stories (not polished TED Talk)
✅ Vulnerability without cringe
✅ Specific numbers + concrete examples
✅ Mistakes, fears, doubts alongside wins
✅ "Sitting across from friend" vibe
✅ Humor + wisdom mix
✅ Self-aware, slightly irreverent

### DON'T
❌ Generic motivational quotes
❌ Corporate speak, marketing fluff
❌ Performance of vulnerability (if optimizing it, you've lost it)
❌ Engagement bait tactics
❌ Over-polished, sanitized content
❌ Trying too hard to be funny
❌ Condescending "guru" tone

### Tone Examples
**Good:** "Shipped 3 features today, broke 2, fixed 1. Progress?"
**Bad:** "🚀 Another day of crushing it! 💪 #buildinpublic"

**Good:** "Revenue: $5K → $15K in 3 months. Profit: $1K → $1.2K. Learned: scaling ≠ profit."
**Bad:** "Just hit $15K MRR! 🎉 Dreams coming true! ✨"

## 8. Quality Checklist

Before posting:
- [ ] Fact-check stats/sources/quotes (Community Notes = reach killer)
- [ ] Specific numbers instead of round? (17 > 20)
- [ ] Hook creates tension/curiosity?
- [ ] Personal story or generic advice? (stories win)
- [ ] External link? → Move to first reply
- [ ] 2-3 relevant hashtags (not generic #success)
- [ ] Posting Tuesday-Thursday 8AM-3PM?
- [ ] Ready to engage in first 2 hours?
- [ ] Feels genuine or performative?
- [ ] Would other builders find this valuable?

---

## 9. Thread Structure

### Optimal Length
**3-5 tweets** = sweet spot (40-60% more impressions than standalone)

### Structure
```
Tweet 1: HOOK (curiosity/tension/transformation)
Tweet 2-4: BODY (story, lessons, specifics)
Tweet 5: CTA (question, retweet ask, link in reply)
```

### Example Framework
```
1/ [Contrarian hook or surprising outcome]

2/ Here's what happened: [Specific story with numbers]

3/ The mistake most people make: [Common approach]

4/ What actually works: [Your approach with results]

5/ Key takeaway: [Actionable insight]

What's your experience with this? 👇
```

## 10. Content Mix (Weekly)

**40% — Build in public updates**
- Shipping updates, metrics with context

- Decision-making process

**30% — Personal stories**

**20% — Valuable insights**

**10% — Engagement**

---

## 11. Revenue Sharing Guidelines

### DO
✅ Show trends over time
✅ Include context (profit, costs, team)
✅ Explain what changed and why
✅ Be honest about challenges

### Example (Good)
```
Revenue update:
Jan: $2K
Mar: $15K
May: $8K ⬅ the reality

What happened:
- Jan-Mar: Viral tweet → spike
- Apr-May: Churn caught up
- Learning: Virality ≠ retention

Now focusing on [specific change].
```

### Example (Bad)
```
🎉 Just hit $15K MRR! 🚀

Dreams do come true! 💪

Keep grinding! 🔥
```

---

## 12. Failure Sharing Framework

### Structure
```
1. What I tried: [Specific thing]
2. What I expected: [Hypothesis]
3. What actually happened: [Reality with numbers]
4. Why it failed: [Analysis, not excuses]
5. What I learned: [Actionable takeaway]
6. What I'm trying next: [New approach]
```

### Why it works
- Builds trust (transparency)
- Relatable (everyone fails)
- Educational (others avoid same mistake)
- Authentic (not marketing)

---

## 13. Engagement Strategy

### Reply Priorities
1. **First 2 hours:** Respond to ALL engagement
2. **Questions:** Answer with value (not just "thanks")
3. **Criticism:** Engage respectfully, learn publicly
4. **Quality over quantity:** Thoughtful > fast

### Value in Conversations
> "The value of content on X isn't baked into the initial tweet but the conversations that happen as a result."

### Community Building
- Tag relevant people (genuinely, not spam)
- RT valuable content from others
- Start conversations, not broadcasts
- Support fellow builders publicly

---

## 14. Video Content (2025 Priority)

### Why Video
- 2-4x more reach than text
- Algorithm strongly favors native video
- 10x more engagement than text-only

### Specs
- **Length:** 15-60 seconds (under 2:20 max)
- **Format:** Vertical preferred
- **Captions:** Always (most watch muted)
- **Quality:** Good enough > perfect

### Content Ideas
- Quick shipping updates
- Bug fixes in real-time
- Design decisions explained
- Revenue dashboard walkthroughs (with context)

---

## 15. Psychological Triggers

### Zeigarnik Effect
Incomplete information creates cognitive tension → must read to resolve

**Use:** Leave knowledge gap in hook, resolve in thread

### Information Gap Theory
Humans experience discomfort when aware of knowledge gaps

**Use:** "Here's the ONE thing that changed everything:" → scroll

### Social Proof
People trust what others validate

**Use:** Retweets, replies, metrics with context (not bragging)

## 20. Golden Rules

### Algorithm
> 1 RT = 20 likes. Optimize for retweets.
> First 2 hours = critical window.
> Video > Threads (3-5) > Text.

### Content
> Personal stories > Generic advice.
> Specific numbers > Round numbers.
> Context with metrics > Metrics alone.

### Voice
> If feels like performance, don't.
> If feels like value to builders, do.
> Vulnerability ≠ optimizing vulnerability.

### Community
> Conversations > Broadcasts.
> Support others > Self-promotion.
> Long-term audience > Short-term followers.

### Authenticity Test
> "Would I share this with founder friend over coffee?"
> Yes → Post
> No → Reconsider
