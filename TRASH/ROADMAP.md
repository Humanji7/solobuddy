# 🗺️ SoloBuddy Roadmap

## 🔥 Discovered Pattern: "Warmup to Inspiration"

During a live session, we discovered how posts actually get written:

```
[Raw draft from SoloBuddy]
        ↓
[5-8 iterations with AI editor]
        ↓
[Questions extract your voice]
        ↓
[Ideas accumulate in your head]
        ↓
[5 minutes → authentic post]
```

**Key insight:** SoloBuddy provides **firewood** (дрова), not the final fire. The dialogue with AI is a **warmup**, not the destination. The final text is written by **the human** when they're ready.

## 🎯 Next Release: Editor Mode

**Goal:** Build the "warmup" phase into SoloBuddy itself.

### Features

- [ ] **Editor persona** — AI asks questions like a good editor:
  - "Who is reading this?"
  - "What emotion should they feel after?"
  - "Where's the concrete story?"
  - "What's the contrarian take?"
  
- [ ] **Framework prompts** — Apply known frameworks:
  - Kevon Cheung (Build in Public)
  - Justin Welsh (Content Matrix)
  - Custom user frameworks

- [ ] **Iteration tracker** — Show warmup progress:
  - "Draft v1 → v5, you're getting closer"
  - Visual indicator of "readiness"

## 🧬 Future: Living SOUL

**Vision:** Projects that truly talk back.

- [ ] **SOUL Protocol v2** — Deeper personality specification
- [ ] **Context memory** — Remember past conversations about commits
- [ ] **Proactive insights** — "You've been avoiding this file for 2 weeks. What's blocking you?"
