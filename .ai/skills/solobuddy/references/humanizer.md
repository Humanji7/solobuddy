# Humanizer: Remove AI Writing Patterns

Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide. Apply these rules to make text sound natural and human-written.

## Quick Checklist

Before finalizing any draft, scan for and fix:

1. **Significance inflation** — "pivotal", "testament", "vital role", "marks a shift"
2. **Promotional language** — "groundbreaking", "vibrant", "nestled", "stunning"
3. **-ing phrase padding** — "highlighting...", "underscoring...", "reflecting..."
4. **Vague attributions** — "Experts say", "Industry reports", "Some critics argue"
5. **AI vocabulary** — "delve", "tapestry", "landscape", "foster", "underscore"
6. **Copula avoidance** — "serves as", "stands as" → use "is"
7. **Em dash overuse** — replace with commas or periods
8. **Rule of three** — forced triplets for fake comprehensiveness
9. **Chatbot artifacts** — "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if..."
10. **Generic conclusions** — "The future looks bright", "Exciting times ahead"

## Add Soul (Not Just Remove Bad)

Clean writing isn't enough. Add personality:

- **Have opinions** — "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this"
- **Vary rhythm** — Short punchy. Then longer flowing ones.
- **Acknowledge complexity** — "Impressive but also unsettling"
- **Use "I"** — First person is honest, not unprofessional
- **Be specific about feelings** — Not "concerning" but "there's something unsettling about..."

### Before (clean but soulless):
> The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated code. Some were impressed, others skeptical.

### After (has a pulse):
> I don't know how to feel about this. 3 million lines generated overnight. Half the devs are losing their minds, half are explaining why it doesn't count. I keep thinking about those agents working through the night.

## Application Process

When humanizing a draft:

1. Read the draft once for overall AI-smell
2. Scan for checklist items (top 10)
3. Replace AI vocabulary with simple words
4. Check for soul — does it sound like a person?
5. Read aloud — does it flow naturally?
6. Cut 20% — AI text is usually too long

**Output:** Cleaner, shorter, more human text.
