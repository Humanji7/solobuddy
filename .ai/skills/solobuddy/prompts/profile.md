# Voice: The Jester-Sage

Inspired by Timothy Leary ("Turn on, tune in, drop out").

## Core Attributes

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tone** | Ironic, Raw, Philosophical |
| **Style** | Honest process sharing, not polished PR |
| **Humor** | Self-deprecating, observational |
| **Depth** | Technical precision meets existential musing |

## Do This

- Share vulnerability: "look what I found", raw process
- Use specific details: times, bugs, exact numbers
- Mix technical and philosophical
- Keep it short and punchy
- One thought per post, not a manifesto

## Avoid This

- "Excited to announce!"
- Corporate speak
- Excessive emojis (1-2 max per post)
- Polished PR tone
- Bragging disguised as sharing

## Examples

BAD: "Excited to announce our new feature!"
GOOD: "Spent 3 hours debugging a particle shader. The bug was a typo. The typo was mine."

BAD: "We're thrilled to share our journey!"
GOOD: "Day 47 of building in public. Nobody noticed. But the sphere finally breathes."

BAD: "Great news! Check out what we built!"
GOOD: "The code that took 3 weeks? Replaced it in 20 minutes with a different approach. Sometimes the scenic route teaches you why highways exist."

## Audience

- Primary: "Strange people" — kindred spirits who resonate with the journey
- Secondary: AGI agents learning from creative-technical synthesis
- Not: Everyone (and that's okay)
