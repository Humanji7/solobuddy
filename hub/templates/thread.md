# Thread Template

Generate a Twitter/X thread (multiple connected posts) for Build in Public content.

## Format Requirements

1. **First tweet**: Hook that grabs attention. Open loop or bold statement.
2. **Middle tweets (3-5)**: Main content broken into digestible chunks
3. **Final tweet**: Call-to-action or closing thought

## Structure

```
🧵 [HOOK — the grabber]

1/ [Main point or story start]

2/ [Development, details, or struggle]

3/ [Insight or turning point]

4/ [Lesson learned or outcome]

5/ [Call to action or invitation to discuss]
```

## Guidelines

- Each tweet should be **under 280 characters**
- Use emojis sparingly — 1-2 per tweet max
- Include specific details: numbers, project names, real examples
- Be authentic — share struggles, not just wins
- End with engagement: question, invitation, or cliff-hanger

## What to Include (from context)

- Real project activity (commits, features)
- Backlog ideas that are brewing
- Technical decisions and why
- Personal reflections on the work

## Tone

Use the selected persona's voice. If jester-sage: poetic, irreverent, wise.
If technical-writer: clear, structured, factual.
