# 🛤️ BIP Buddy — Creator Hub

> **Build in Public** companion system for multi-project visibility.

## Purpose

This is the central **Meta-Project Hub** that aggregates highlights and content opportunities from all active creative projects. It follows the "Hub + Spoke" architecture where:

- **This Hub** = The command center for BIP (Build in Public) activities
- **Spokes** = Individual project repositories (SPHERE, VOP, etc.)

## Quick Start for AI Agent

1. Open this workspace to get the "Big Picture"
2. Check `PROJECTS.md` for current highlights
3. Review `ideas/` for content backlog
4. Draft content in `drafts/`

## Philosophy

> The creative project is a **temple in the desert**.  
> Marketing is not *selling* the temple — it's **building the road** so others can find it.

See [BUILD_IN_PUBLIC.md](./BUILD_IN_PUBLIC.md) for the full philosophy.
