# I stopped organizing my thoughts. I gave them a place to live.

You have an idea. It's half-formed, buzzing. You open your notes app. Create a file. Think about which folder. By the time you decide, the idea is gone.

I've tried everything. Notion, Obsidian, Roam, Apple Notes, paper, voice memos. None of them felt right.

## The office metaphor

Our tools come from the 1970s. Files. Folders. Documents. Desktops. We took the language of bureaucracy and called it productivity.

But ideas aren't documents. They're not meant to be filed.

Offices are dying. Remote work, AI, creators building alone. Everything moves toward something fluid. But we still organize our minds like filing clerks.

## What if thoughts had a place?

Not a folder. A living space.

I built SPHERE. A creature made of 5000 particles. It breathes. Reacts. Remembers when you were last here.

First version was visual. A fidget. Friends said "weirdly emotional" and "I keep coming back and I don't know why."

That was enough to keep going.

Surface works. Now I'm building the interior. A space where your voice becomes part of it. Ideas don't get organized. They live somewhere.

## Not a product pitch

SPHERE isn't done. The interior is being designed. Voice exists but memory doesn't. The soul is still being tuned.

I'm writing because the hypothesis feels true:

**We don't need better organization. We need spaces that feel alive.**

Places where you visit your ideas, not manage them. Where the interface breathes.

The next tools won't look like spreadsheets.

## Try it

Visual layer is live. Touch it. Notice what happens in your body before your mind names it.

Interior is coming. Leave email if you want in first.
